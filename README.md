Here is the link to a short article I wrote about adversarial noise and the need to develop robust algorithms - [Click Here](https://medium.com/@deepika.vadlamudi77/a-brief-introduction-to-adversarial-examples-faf89cea6201)

But to give you a brief introduction to adversarial examples and the need to develop robust algorithms, consider the following example: 

Let us consider an example of a Self-driving car. These cars are usually capable of identifying common road signs. But what if an ill-intended adversary replaces a regular stop sign with another stop sign that has some calculated noise added to it which makes these self-driven cars identify it as a smiley face instead? This may end up causing loss of life even. Hence, studying these attacks and having algorithms that are tolerant to these noises are the need of the hour.
